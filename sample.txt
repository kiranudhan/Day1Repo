JAVA was developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems Inc in the year 1995, later 
acquired by Oracle Corporation. It is a simple programming language. Java makes writing, 
compiling, and debugging programming easy. It helps to create reusable code and modular 
programs. Java is a class-based, object-oriented programming language and is designed to 
have as few implementation dependencies as possible. A general-purpose programming 
language made for developers to write once run anywhere that is compiled Java code can 
run on all platforms that support Java. Java applications are compiled to byte code that 
can run on any Java Virtual Machine. The syntax of Java is similar to c/c++. History: 
Javaâ€™s history is very interesting. It is a programming language created in 1991. James 
Gosling, Mike Sheridan, and Patrick Naughton, a team of Sun engineers known as the Green 
team initiated the Java language in 1991. Sun Microsystems released its first public 
implementation in 1996 as Java 1.0. It provides no-cost -run-times on popular platforms. 
Java1.0 compiler was re-written in Java by Arthur Van Hoff to strictly comply with its 
specifications. With the arrival of Java 2, new versions had multiple configurations 
built for different types of platforms.

In 1997, Sun Microsystems approached the ISO standards body and later formalized Java, 
but it soon withdrew from the process. At one time, Sun made most of its Java 
implementations available without charge, despite their proprietary software status. Sun 
generated revenue from Java through the selling of licenses for specialized products 
such as the Java Enterprise System.
